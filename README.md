# HousePricePredictionModel
HousePricePredictionModel is a machine learning model made to predict California's housing prices, using advanced data processing and model optimization techniques for accurate predictions 

- Preprocessed the data using log transformations to account for skewness, and explored datasets with matplotlib and seaborn
- Trained various regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, to find the best fit
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, significantly improving the model's mean squared error (MSE)
- Achieved high accuracy with iterative testing and analysis
